CPP: Lab 1
- This is a very casual lab designed to introduce you to C++. Mess around with some of it's features we kind of
hinted at.
- Ensure to set this up as a C++ project in Visual Studio or compile using G++ if using another editor or Linux
Instructions:
- A number is considered to be relatively prime to another if the greatest common denominator of both is 1.
- Euler's Totient Function – phi(n) – tallies up all the numbers that are relatively prime to a number n
- I have provided a program that implements Euler’s Totient Function to find a count of all numbers {1, 2, 3, …, n} that are relatively prime to a number n.
- Two functions to solve this problem have been provided but need to be completed, as well as a main().
-- int phi(unsigned int n) – this function should iterate through the number set to tally all numbers relative prime to n.
-- int gcd(const int, const int b) – this function should return the greatest common denominator of two numbers.
- Try using some of the new C++ features we covered. Experiment with auto, decltype, const, and references.
