Instructions:
* You are provided with a text file that contains the best song lyrics in the world
    * Problem is... the song lyrics are encrypted with a simple XOR.
* You will need to decrypt the lyrics
    * The key is 27
    * You have been provided with a decent chunk of the code with conditionals and loops already created...
    * Feel free to create yours from scratch if you want a greater challange. 
* You will need to think outside the box. Remember what XOR is, the type of data it acts on, how much data, etc.
